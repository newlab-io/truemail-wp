== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How does it work?
Once the TrueMail plugin is installed and activated, it will detect and check email fields present on the form when the form is submitted. During form submit, our plugin will make an API request to our service https://truemail.io with an email that needs to be verified. If the email verification results do not coincide with the ones you allowed, it will show an error message to the person entering the email address. When the email provided by the user is acceptable, form submission will proceed normally.

How long does the email verification take?

The email verification takes from few seconds to several minutes, depending on the type of the email address. If such an email has greylisting, the verification can take more.

How accurate are the results?

The accuracy of the results is about 99,9%.

Does it verify catch-all emails as well?
Yes, the TrueMail plugin can detect ‘catch-all’ emails with the highest accuracy.
